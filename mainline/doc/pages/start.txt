====== PhobOS ======

PhobOS â€“ object-oriented operating system completely written in C++. During its design author attempted to get the best ideas from Linux, FreeBSD and Windows(((many things noted there which should not be done in your OS :-))) design and implement them using object-oriented programming principles. The system is designed to support only one architecture - x86 PC. Another idea is to implement support only for the most recent hardware and system software (BIOS and firmware) standards and do not support obsolete legacy devices, interface and specifications. Many original ideas were used in the system concept development.
