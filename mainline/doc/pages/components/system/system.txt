===== Applications I/O =====

Streaming interface is used for applications I/O. All streams are named. The process is created with four predefined streams:

  - "input" for input data;
  - "output" for output data;
  - "trace" for diagnostic readable output;
  - "log" for diagnostic logged readable output.
 
Virtual terminals are used to handle console sessions. Each VT has console device associated. Each console has input and output character device associated. Consoles can be shared between several VTs but only one VT can own the console at the time.
